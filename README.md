For this web development project, i took ideas from the louvre(paris) museum located in france and applied it to the National gallery singapore while keeping main features of the national gallery of singapore.

Design Process
While designing this webpage, i thought that the visitors of the national gallery of singapore were going to be mostly tourist so i wanted to adapt a concept that they were more familiar with.

The main purpose of revamping this website was so that there was a content and layout refresh as the national gallery singapore has the same website over many years. So by working on this project i aimed to give the users/visitors a fresh look/feel of the website.

Features
As for the features, there is separated forms for both singaporeans/PR and non singaporeans i have combined this into one form where you can select from a drop down box as for your nationality. The javascript code and logic behind this will calculate the price to pay accordingly | singaporeans/PR($0 _ number of tickets) Non-singaporeans($13 _ number of tickets) In this project, I know that the national gallery is frequented by visitors and some visitors might not be familiar with where the national gallery is located in singapore so i have included a interactive map where they can see where the national gallery of singapore is exactly located.
